In this example I have show very simple example of caching. Caching is the ability to retrieve often used data quickly, so the data needs 
to be stored somewhere for it to be retrieved. The std::vector is most often used for this since it is guaranteed to be stored in 
contiguous memory which allows the linear search to be efficiently performed. Now most caching solutions involve a Least recently used 
algorithm to remove least recently used data from the container so the most recently used is near the front of the container which supports fast search times.
Using const variables will allow the compiler to store the value in the register for quick retrieval later The register keyword can be 
used to tell the compiler that it will be accessed a lot and to keep the variable in a machine register. For instance, you may put a loop 
index in a register as it will be accessed many time around the loop which would give a performance benefit. For example,

for(register int i = 0; i < 9999999; i++){}

In the code you will also see the use of keywords alignas and alignof keywords for word(memory block) alignment.
