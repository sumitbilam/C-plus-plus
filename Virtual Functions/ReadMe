Virtual Functions - When you use inheritance, you often find that the derived classes need to implement specialized versions of some member
functions from the base class. For example, the Person class might define a display() member function to display a person's name and age,
whereas the Student class might want to display the student's course as well. This is known as "overriding". 
To define overridable member functions properly in C++, you must prefix the function with the virtual keyword in the base class definition.

I have created Person as a base class and inherited Student class from it publically. You will notice display() function has been declared as
virtual fucntion in Person.h and Student.h
